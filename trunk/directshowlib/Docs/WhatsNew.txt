v 1.5 - Minor upgrade (2006-08-02)

In addition to testing an additional 20 interfaces, we have also updated the existing 
definitions to enable c# code to *implement* these interfaces (instead of just calling them).  
This also fixes a fairly messy problem that could occur if you attempted to run regasm 
against the DirectShowLib.dll.

361 Defined
250 Tested
 33 Deprecated & undocumented
 20 Are untestable due to hw constraints (no filters implement)
 27 Are untestable due to DS bugs
 31 Are untestable due to various other reasons


See Interfaces.txt for the current list of tested interfaces.



v 1.4 - Minor upgrade (2006-04-12)

I didn't think we'd be doing another release quite so soon.  No, it isn't because we found
bugs.  We decided to rebuild the library and samples under vs2005.  We have added a solution 
and csproj file to the library and each of the samples so that you can compile them under 
either vs2003 or vs2005.  

Well, all right, we found 1 bug: MPEG1WaveFormat was declared as a struct, and should have been 
a class.  After nearly 12,000 downloads, this is only the 5th bug found in the library.  Not bad.

Further, we have split the samples off in to a separate download.  Now that the library is 
"finished", it doesn't make sense to tie the release of samples to the release of the library.
See the Samples package for a description of new samples.

V 1.3 - Minor upgrade (2006-03-16)

Note: As of this release, there are no more interfaces to be tested in DirectShow v9.0c.  So,
until Microsoft releases a new version of DS (or until bugs are found in the existing library),
no more releases of this library are planned.  

However, additional samples, and "sister" libraries (DirectDraw, Windows Media Format, etc) 
are being discussed.  There has also been talk of wrapping these low-level interfaces into 
classes and making a true DirectShow Class library.  We'll see.

63 more interfaces tested.
