V 1.3 - Minor upgrade

Note: As of this release, there are no more interfaces to be tested in DirectShow v9.0c.  So,
until Microsoft releases a new version of DS (or until bugs are found in the existing library),
no more releases of this library are planned.  

However, additional samples, and "sister" libraries (DirectDraw, Windows Media Format, etc) 
are being discussed.  There has also been talk of wrapping these low-level interfaces into 
classes and making a true DirectShow Class library.  We'll see.

63 more interfaces tested.
